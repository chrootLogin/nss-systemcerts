NSS-SystemCerts
===============

This package provides a few shell utilities to merge the system-wide certificate store,
available in ``/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt``, and a NSS-compatible store living in
``/etc/pki/nssdb`` (the default path of the system-wide library defined in NSS).

Background
----------

NSS has a much wider set of features than the system-wide trusted certificates whitelist:
- Trusting a certificate for various uses (server authentication, email signing, ...)
- Distrusting a certificate trusted by another source (e.g user database removing system-wide defaults)

It can also work with both user-specific and system-wide databases.
- The system-wide is expected to be in ``/etc/pki/nssdb``
- The user-specific db lives in ``$HOME/.pki/nssdb``

Purpose
-------

The system-wide NSS database has no relation with the system-wide certificate store.
This tool tries to bridge that gap, by permitting:
- Initialization of the system-wide NSS database
- Updating the system-wide NSS database whenever a new certificate is added to the system-wide store
- Listing differences between both databases.

nss-systemcerts-import
----------------------

This tool creates a NSS database from the system-wide certificate store.

It accepts the following options:

- ``-n``, ``--dry-run``: don't do anything, just print what would be performed
- ``-s``, ``--system-store``: path to the system store (defaults to ``/etc/ssl/certs``)
- ``-d``, ``--nss-db``: path to the NSS database, as understood by NSS ``certutil`` tool.
  Defaults to ``/etc/pki/nssdb``

nss-systemcerts-hook
--------------------

This short script is a hook for ``update-ca-certificates``, and should be symlinked to ``/etc/ca-certificates/update.d/``.
